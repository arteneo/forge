Utilities are set of helper functions to make our life easier while developing the application.

## dev and prod Environment

TODO

`isDev()` and `isProd()` - frontend

How to change it - `.env`

How it is used:
- translations (on DEV = debug, on PROD = nothing)
- HandleCatch (on DEV = console log, on PROD = redirect to correpsonding error)
